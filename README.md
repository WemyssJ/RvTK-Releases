## RvTK Command Centre

The RvTK Command Centre provides a centralised location for users to access and organise their everyday Revit workflows.

The customisable **Favourites Panel** allows users to create their own personalised workspace by adding:

* RvTK tools
* Native Revit commands
* Commands from other Revit add-ins and plugins

This provides a single access point for the tools users rely on most, reducing the need to navigate through multiple ribbon tabs and interfaces.

---

## BIM Manager Configuration

RvTK includes comprehensive configuration options designed for BIM Managers to manage, customise, and distribute settings across their organisation.

This allows companies to tailor RvTK to suit their own workflows, standards, and project requirements, ensuring teams have consistent access to the tools and settings they need.

Configuration options can be managed centrally and distributed to users, helping improve consistency, support BIM standards, and simplify deployment across project teams.

---

## Installation & Updates

RvTK is designed to be simple to install and update.

### Installation

1. Download the latest RvTK release package.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Ensure Autodesk Revit is closed.
4. Run the RvTK installer (`.exe`).
5. Open Revit and RvTK will be available.

No additional configuration is required for a standard installation.

Administrator permissions may be required depending on your organisation's security settings.

### Uninstalling RvTK

RvTK includes a dedicated uninstaller that allows users to remove the add-in and manage stored configuration settings.

> **Note:** The RvTK uninstaller is located at:
>
> ```
> %appdata%\RvTK\RvTK uinstaller\uninstaller.exe

## Trial Period & Feedback

Each installation of RvTK includes a **45-day trial period**, allowing users to explore and test the available tools.

During the development phase, the trial period will be renewed with each new patch release, ensuring users testing the latest improvements have continued access.

Feedback, bug reports, and feature suggestions are encouraged and can be submitted directly through the **inbuilt feedback button within RvTK**.

## BIM Manager Deployment

RvTK includes built-in tools to support organisation-wide deployment and configuration management.

BIM Managers can customise RvTK Settings to suit their organisation's workflows, standards, and requirements, then export the configuration package for distribution across other machines.

### Deployment Workflow

1. Configure RvTK Settings on the designated BIM Manager machine.
2. Export the RvTK configuration package.
3. Distribute the configuration package to the required users or machines.
4. Import the configuration package on each machine.

This allows organisations to maintain consistent RvTK settings across teams, helping standardise workflows, improve productivity, and support company BIM standards.

Further deployment options and management features will continue to be developed.
